    <h1>Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container mb-5">

    <p>Jinnah, a man of principles, set very high standards and values in politics. He never compromised on principles.
      Gutter politics was not his style.
      Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s statesmanship lay in his two traits;
    </p>

    <p>Firstly his rational approach towards
      politics, and secondly his keen knowledge
      of objective ground realities, however awkward or complex, he made the right choice at the right moment. He was no
      doubt one of the most
      charismatic leaders in recent history.
    </p>

    <p>”Character, courage, industry and perseverance are the four pillars on which the whole edifice of human life can
      be built and failure
      is a word unknown to me.”– <b>Jinnah’s life philosophy.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Admirable Qualities</h2>
    <p>Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a visionary leader and the founding father of Pakistan. Here
      are few of his infinite leadership qualities that our youth must follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Courage:</b>
        In the whole span of the parliamentary career of the subcontinent, Jinnah was the most courageous leader
        who raised his voice for the freedom of India. His courage to support Indians in front of the British made him
        the leader of the group inside the legislature.
        As a leader, Jinnah never let his nation lose hope.
        Our youth should learn the courage and confidence Jinnah had in his attitude.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><b>Dedication:</b>
        Quaid-e-Azam was a dedicated man. He dedicated his whole life to Pakistan and even ignored his health while
        accomplishing his duties as a leader. He worked himself to death.
        Jinnah dedicated himself to his homeland. He knew that although the foundation of Pakistan has been laid,
        a lot more was needed to be done to build and develop this new state.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><b>Integrity:</b>
        Quaid-e-Azam was a man of principles. The high standards he set in politics, the values he followed, and the
        statesmanship he exhibited, are the proof of his integrity.
        It would not be wrong to call him a charismatic leader who earned popularity all over the world with his
        integrity and principles.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><b>Vision:</b>
        Quaid’s vision was clear from day one of his journey. He wanted a separate homeland for Muslims. Pakistan seems\
        a miracle to many but for Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was his dream. He wanted a separate, progressive, and
        independent state for Muslims.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4">
        <b>Honesty:</b>
        Quaid-e-Azam was an honest leader with a clear vision. He was honest and loyal to his work, responsibilities,
        and above all to his homeland.
        There’s no doubt in saying that honesty and truthfulness were the hallmarks of Jinnah.
        Quaid always demanded his nation to be honest. He always wanted to receive the honest opinions of his people,
        whether it was in his favor or criticism, he always appreciate truthfulness.
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4">
        <b>Commitment:</b>
        Being a leader, Jinnah showcased an impactful committed behavior to the cause of Pakistan. Pakistan is the proof
        of Quaid-e-Azam’s commitment. He never let his people lose hope and abandon their aim.
        The key to his successful commitment was simply to ignore failure and move ruthlessly towards the successful
        achievement of his ambitions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stanley Wolpert about Jinnah</h2>
    <p>"Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly
      anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah did all three."
    </p>


    <h2>Jawaharlal Nehru about Jinnah </h2>
    <p>Jawaharlal Nehru India’s first Prime minister and Jinnah’s long-time political adversary while reflecting on
      Jinnah described him as:
    </p>
    <p>”One of the most extraordinary men in history.”</p>
